Over the past few months AI art has been exploding in popularity with websites such as [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) offering their services for free. I've spent a couple hours messing around with Midjourney today, here are some of my creations.
