I ordered a pack of [luxe mini cards](https://www.moo.com/us/business-cards/minicards) by Moo and I think they're pretty neat, take a look!

I chose to keep my cards as simple and concise as possible with only my name on one side and my email on the other. In my eyes this helps them stand out from the crowd, less is more. Also these cards are ***THICC***! The seam along the edge really shows how thick these things are.

Luxe mini cards are 10/10 in my book.
